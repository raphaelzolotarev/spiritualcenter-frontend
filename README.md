## Organization
Efficient project management and team collaboration are facilitated using modern agile methodologies.

## Agile Workflow
- Agile principles ensure iterative development with continuous feedback.
- Scrum framework implemented through JIRA, optimizing sprint planning and backlog management.

## Data Modeling
Structured data design for scalability and efficiency:
- **Requirements List** – Defining business needs and expected functionalities.
- **Conceptual Model** – High-level representation of entities and relationships.
- **Logical Model** – Structuring the database schema with attributes and keys.
- **Physical Model** – Optimizing storage and indexing for performance.

## Backend Technologies
